**TECHIN 600, Independent Research / University of Washington** <br>
Graduate Teaching/Research Assistant, Graduate Course / Summer 2023

> 2 students, with Linda Wagner, M.S. and John Raiti Ph.D. (instructors) <br>
> This independent research is intended to support an industry sponsored GIX's Launch Project in Autumn 2023. Our summer study specifically focuses on understanding the human experience during urban heat events. Student activities include planning and conducting a field study to deploy wearable sensors to collect longitudinal physiological and qualitative data on perceived heat-related events. Due to the limited number of students and time constraint, I took the lead in managing all aspects of the project, which include tasks ranging from creating IRB application and related documents to participant recruitment, onboarding and scheduling, data collection monitoring, and study troubleshooting.

**HCDE 313, Introduction to User Research / University of Washington** <br>
Graduate Teaching Assistant, Undergraduate Course / Spring 2023

> 37 students, with Gary Hsieh, Ph.D. (instructor) <br>
> This course introduces a wide range of user research methods. Through engaging class activities and lectures, students gain a foundation of the interplay between design requirements and research questions, different types of user research analysis and communication, the ethical considerations in human subjects research, as well as the practical applications of user research in engineering and design contexts. As part of their learning experience, students actively participate in hands-on, group-based projects spanning three phases with a research topic of each group's choosing, allowing them to explore areas of interest. Throughout the phases, they employ naturalistic observations, interviews, and surveys to gather valuable data, in which I provide feedback based on their project proposals and reports, encouraging continuous improvement and fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

**HCDE 496/596, AR Avatars in Online Group Interactions / University of Washington** <br>
Co-Director, Undergraduate + Graduate Course / Winter, Spring 2023

> 6 students, with Mark Zachry, Ph.D. (co-director) <br>
> This DRG explored literature related to the use of AR avatars for group collaborative interactions, designed the study research kit (e.g., study protocol, interview questions, and appararus material design), and ran pilot sessions.
