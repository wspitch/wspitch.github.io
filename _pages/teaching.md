Below is the list of courses I have TAed at the University of Washington.

**HCID 510: Design of Interactive Systems** (2025 Spring)
<br>
Explores the intellectual foundations of design thinking, traditions, and perspectives in the design of interactive systems. Through in-depth reading, critical analysis, structured discussions, guest lectures, and presentations, students develop thought-leadership frameworks designed to guide their future-forward work as emerging technology leaders.

**HCDE 592: MS Capstone Planning** (2025 Winter)
<br>
Typically proposed by industry sponsors, student teams engage in the research phase of their capstone projects. Grounded in a human-centered lens, they identify and define a problem/opportunity space, execute formative user research, synthesize insights, and develop provisional solution concepts (i.e., design principles and requirements).

**HCDE 501: Theoretical Foundations of HCDE** (2024 Fall, 2024 Winter, 2023 Fall)
<br>
Survey of major theoretical perspectives that inform work in human centered design and engineering. Through reading, writing, and team projects, students examine the complexities of interaction, communication, and technology as configured in different influential theoretical frameworks; the implications of these different configurations; and why these differences matter to people engaged in professional practice or research.

**HCID 541: Capstone Studio** (2024 Summer)
<br>
Building on the research studio, 10 student teams engage in concept development, iterative design, prototyping, and evaluation to address identified key challenges. Throughout the process, teams work closely with both faculty and industry advisors to develop innovative solutions and deliver compelling presentations.

**HCDE 593: MS Capstone** (2024 Spring)
<br>
Building on their identified problem space and research findings, student teams enagge in ideation, prototyping, and evaluation to develop and deliver their final solution/design/product.

**HCDE 313: User Research** (2023 Spring)
<br>
Introduces user research methods and how to effectively plan, conduct, analyze, and communicate the results within engineering and design context. Student work in teams to carry out major methods including field observations, interviews, and surveys.
