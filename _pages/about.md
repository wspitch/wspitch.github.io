I'm a 3rd-year PhD student, advised by [Mark Zachry, PhD][mark], in [Human Centered Design & Engineering][hcde] (HCDE) at the [University of Washington][uw]. My current research focuses on understanding and supporting design for human-centered AI, often drawing from mixed-methods (i.e., experimental and qualitative) and design research approaches.

Previously, I led user research studies on AR interfaces and interactions, including the use of AR headsets, screen-based avatars, and filters for mediated interactions and experiences.

I have a B.S. in [Human Factors Psychology][hf] from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University][erau]. There, I worked closely with [Barbara S. Chaparro, PhD][barb] in the [RUX Lab][rux] to conduct experiments on UX and usability of interaction methods in/with AR. Sponsored by a Top Fortune 100 Tech company, I worked on a team to evaluate perceived comfort with smart product materials and validate a toolkit's comprehensiveness in assessing product design impressions.

Please reach out to discuss possible collaboration/internship opportunities üñ§
