I'm a rising second-year Ph.D. student, advised by [Mark Zachry, Ph.D.][mark], in the department of [Human Centered Design & Engineering][hcde] (HCDE) at the [University of Washington][uw]. My research interests encompass human-computer interaction and emerging technologies. I am driven by the potential of emerging technologies to revolutionize how we think and work with augmented information, while keeping humans at the forefront. By combining experimental and qualitative research methods, my current work focuses on understanding the use of immersive technologies (e.g., augmented reality and avatars) for digitally-mediated interactions and human perception. 

<small> I am slowly working on shifting my research direction. Stay tuned for future updates! </small>

I graduated from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University][erau] in 2022 with a B.S. in [Human Factors Psychology][hf]. There, I worked closly with [Barbara S. Chaparro, Ph.D.][barb] in the [Research in User eXperience (RUX) Lab][rux], where I led experimental studies to investigate user experience and usability of interaction methods in augmented/mixed reality. I also had the opportunity to work on evaluating perceived comfort with smart product materials and validating a toolkit's comprehensiveness in assessing product design impressions, sponsored by a Top Fortune 100 Tech company.
