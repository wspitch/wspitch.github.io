I'm a 4th-year PhD candidate in [Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE)][hcde] at the [University of Washington][uw], advised by [Mark Zachry, PhD][mark]. My research explores human-centered AI + design innovation, investigating how designers envision, reflect on, and negotiate human and societal values in early-stage AI concept development. I study and design mechanisms that support value-oriented design in the age of AI, ultimately aiming to create empirical, practical, and human-centered responses/approaches that empower designers and AI product teams to design more responsibly and imaginatively.

Currently, my projects focus on: (1) envisioning practices of AI concepts with AI; (2) creating a value-focused toolkit to support AI concept reflection; and (3) developing design principles for preventing harmful applications in AI concept development. My work bridges qualitative, quantitative, and design research methods to uncover insights that inform human-centered AI design strategies. My thinking is broadly shaped by questions around design for/with AI, value sensitive design, and materiality.

Before my current PhD work, I led user research on AR interfaces and interactions, examining how AR headsets, systems UI, avatars, and filters shape mediated experience. I hold a B.S. in [Human Factors Psychology][hf] from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University][erau], where I worked with [Barbara S. Chaparro, PhD][barb] in the [RUX Lab][rux]. There, I conducted experiments on AR usability and UX, and collaborated with a Top Fortune 10 tech company to evaluate perceived comfort with smart product materials and validate a toolkit for assessing product design impressions.

I'm actively seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities â€“ please reach out if you'd like to collaborate ðŸ–¤
